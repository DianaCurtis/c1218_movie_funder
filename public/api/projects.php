 /*

Objective: Insert the data that the user has given us into our database in the projects table.

We expect multiple strings from the client upon accepting the comparable pictures.
    The strings are title, year, logline, synopsis, production_stage, and genre

We will then sanitize each string and store it in a variable.

We will send the INSERT query to the database seperate from the variables in a prepared statement

We will then INSERT the  strings into the projects table and send a response of TRUE when it is completed
